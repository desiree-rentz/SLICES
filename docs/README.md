# Introduction

In previous generations of testbeds, radio and compute resources were the only
resources of interest for the experimenters and the interconnection
infrastructure was then hidden. However, when it comes to 5G, the
interconnection itself (e.g., optical fibre links and switches) take place in
the treatment of the workload and they shall be exposed to the testbed users.

Since every testbed can be different, we explore several potential architectures
that could be used and discuss their advantages and drawbacks.

We however focus on the SophiaNode, which is a perfect case study to understand
how to inter-connect equipment from both a logical and a physical point of view.
